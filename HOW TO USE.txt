In this project the code is served as jupyter notebook with python 3 version.
Models are saved in 4 catagores i.e. categorical models (cat_models dir),
final models (final_models dir), main models (main_models dir), synthetic data
used models (smoted_models).


As it is not used for publishing any research paper, the usable parameters are 
not described or shown properly. So the models cannot be used by normal parameters
as it has been label_encoded and scaled for insertion into the model. The trainable
interface is not developed as the main model was for demonstration purposes and 
cross-validation setup.
